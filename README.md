## light-reid
a toolbox for light-reid learning, including:
- [x] **light model**: model distillation and pruning (1.5x-2x faster)
- [x] **light feature**: binary code learning (10x faster)
- [x] **light retrieval**: coarse2fine retrieval (5x faster)

### Update
- 2020.07.17: We release a toolbox for light-reid learning, getting >50x faster speed. Code comming soon.
* 2020.03.27: We adapt bag-of-tricks-reid to python3.7, and support IBN-Net, MSMT17, combineall, multi-dataset train. Please see branch [version_py3.7 bot](https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid/tree/version_py3.7_bot).
- 2019.03: We give a simple and clear implementation of bag-of-tricks-reid with python2.7. Please see branch [version_py2.7](https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid/tree/version_py2.7).
